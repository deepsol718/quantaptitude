<h1>Time and Work Logic </h1>
<h2>Relation between AB, BC, CA and ABC </h2>
<h3>If time required to do a piece of work by P1(person 1), P2(person 2), P3(person3) are A, B, C respectively. the speed <br> of P1, P2, P3 will be S1, S2, S3 respectively. The time required to do a work by P1 & P2, P2 & P3, P3 & P1 are x, y, z <br> respectively. T is time required by A, B, C all. We will find  relation between them.
</h3>
<h2>Note: The of individual person will be the reciprocal of their time. for example speed of P1 will be <br> S1 = 1/A. <br>
</h2>
<h4> 1. If we add the speed of P1&P2, P2&P3, P3&P1 we will get the speed that would be twice the speed of all three if they <br> work together. Why?<br>
	because the total speed of all three is sum of speed of P1, P2, P3 and in the above statement we have added speed of <br> each individual two times.<br>
	2. If speed of P1&P2 is given and speed of P3 is given then the total speed would be the sum of speed by P1&P2 and P3 <br> directly. Why?<br>
	Because In average speed we can not add two speed together but we have to first find the total distance and total time <br> then we find the speed but here in TIME AND WORK we add speed together because the amount of work is always same that is<br> not for the distance in speed. Think!  <br>
