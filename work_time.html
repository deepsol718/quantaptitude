<h1>Time and Work Logic </h1>
<h2>Unitary method/ Chocolate Method </h2>
<h3>We have learned chocolate method to solve problems of time and work. Let understand the logic behind this method.
</h3>
<h4>Lets take an example of two persons, A takes 15 days and B takes 10 days to complete a work.<br>
now, we have to calculate the days required to do the same amount of work if they start working together?<br>
solution = first take the number of days that that can be easily divisible by each workers no of days i.e.<br>
find LCM of the two.<br>
for our case it is 30.<br>
now, if A start working for 30 days. he will complete that work 2 times. similarly B will complete 3 times of that work.<br>
if both started together they would have completed the work 5 times in 30 days. so, to check the number of days they will<br>take to complete the work once would be simply divide 30 by 5 i.e. 6 days.
 </h4>
 <h3>
 Lets take a look at what we have done.<br>
 steps to calculate no of days worker take if they start together:<br>
1. calculate the LCM.<br>
2. calculate the number of times individual worker can complete that work in LCM days.<br>
3. add the number of times of work of each worker which will give total numbers of times a worker will do work if they<br> started together and work of LCM days.<br>
4. divide the LCM by total no of times.<br>
5. the result of step 4 will give u the numbers of days total worker will take to work to complete the work once.<br>
</h3>
<h2>Note: We calculated the LCM to make our calculation easy.<br> we can take any number of days but taking LCM is the simplest way to do it.
